## Description

This API application is used for the Good Reading Bookstore. The codes are refactored into different files for each has its own functionality. The business logic of the API is stored in the controller.js, the queries to communicate with the PostgreSQL database are stored in the queries.js, and the endpoint routes are stored in the routes.js. The db.js is used for storing the Pool connection to the PostgreSQL, in which the database credentials are saved in the .env file. The server.js serves as the entry-point of the back end.
